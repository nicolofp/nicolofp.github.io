abstract={Background: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals, detected in 95{\%} of Americans, that induce osteotoxicity and modulate hormones, thereby influencing bone health. Previous studies found associations between individual PFAS and bone mineral density in adults but did not analyze their combined effects. Objective:  To extend weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to a Bayesian framework (Bayesian extension of the WQS regression [BWQS]) and determine the association between a mixture of serum PFAS and mineral density in lumbar spine, total, and neck femur in 499 adults from the 2013 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods:  We used BWQS to assess the combined association of eight PFAS, as a mixture, with bone mineral density in adults. As secondary analyses, we focused on vulnerable populations (men over 50 years and postmenopausal women). Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Sensitivity analyses included bone mineral density associations with individual compounds and results from WQS regressions. Results:  The mean age was 55 years old (SD = 1) with average spine, total, and neck femur mineral densities of 1.01 (SD = 0.01), 0.95 (SD = 0.01), and 0.78 (SD = 0.01) gm/cm2, respectively. PFAS mixture levels showed no evidence of association with mineral density (spine: $\beta$ = −0.004; 95{\%} credible interval [CrI] = −0.04, 0.04; total femur: $\beta$ = 0.002; 95{\%} CrI = −0.04, 0.05; femur neck: $\beta$ = 0.005; 95{\%}CrI = −0.03, 0.04) in the overall population. Results were also null in vulnerable populations. Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses. Conclusions:  We introduced a Bayesian extension of WQS and found no evidence of the association between PFAS mixture and bone mineral density.},

abstract={Background: Prenatal exposure to organochlorine compounds (OCs) has been associated with increased childhood body mass index (BMI); however, only a few studies have focused on longitudinal BMI trajectories, and none of them used multiple exposure mixture approaches. Aim:  To determine the association between in-utero exposure to eight OCs and childhood BMI measures (BMI and BMI z-score) at 4 years and their yearly change across 4--12 years of age in 279 Rhea child-mother dyads. Methods:  We applied three approaches: (1) linear mixed-effect regressions (LMR) to associate individual compounds with BMI measures; (2) Bayesian weighted quantile sum regressions (BWQSR) to provide an overall OC mixture association with BMI measures; and (3)Bayesian varying coefficient kernel machine regressions (BVCKMR) to model nonlinear and nonadditive associations. Results:  In the LMR, yearly change of BMI measures was consistently associated with a quartile increase in hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (estimate [95{\%} Confidence or Credible interval] BMI: 0.10 [0.06, 0.14]; BMI z-score: 0.02 [0.01, 0.04]). BWQSR results showed that a quartile increase in mixture concentrations was associated with yearly increase of BMI measures (BMI: 0.10 [0.01, 0.18]; BMI z-score: 0.03 [0.003, 0.06]). In the BVCKMR, a quartile increase in dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene concentrations was associated with higher BMI measures at 4 years (BMI: 0.33 [0.24, 0.43]; BMI z-score: 0.19 [0.15, 0.24]); whereas a quartile increase in HCB and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)-118 levels was positively associated with BMI measures yearly change (BMI: HCB:0.10 [0.07, 0.13], PCB-118:0.08 [0.04, 012]; BMI z-score: HCB:0.03 [0.02, 0.05], PCB-118:0.02 [0.002,04]). BVCKMR suggested that PCBs had nonlinear relationships with BMI measures, and HCB interacted with other compounds. Conclusions:  All analyses consistently demonstrated detrimental associations between prenatal OC exposures and childhood BMI measures.},

Extant studies have combined population studies and identified an overall mixture-outcome association, without accounting for differences across studies.Objective To extend the novel Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sum (BWQS) regression to a hierarchical framework to analyze mixtures across multiple cohorts of different sample sizes.Methods We implemented a hierarchical BWQS (HBWQS) approach that (i) aggregates sample size of multiple cohorts to calculate an overall mixture index, thereby identifying the most harmful exposure(s) across cohorts; and (ii) provides cohort-specific associations between the overall mixture index and the outcome. We showed results from six simulated scenarios including four mixture components in five and ten populations, and two real case-examples on the association between prenatal metal mixture exposure{\textemdash}comprising arsenic, cadmium and lead{\textemdash}and both gestational age and gestational age acceleration metrics.Results Results from simulated scenarios showed good empirical coverage and little bias for all parameters estimated with HBWQS. The Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) for the HBWQS regression showed a better average performance across scenarios than the BWQS regression. HBWQS results incorporating cohorts within the national Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program from three different sites (Boston, New York City (NYC), and Virginia) showed that the environmental mixture{\textemdash}composed of low levels of arsenic, cadmium, and lead{\textemdash}was negatively associated with gestational age in NYC..Conclusions This novel statistical approach facilitates the combination of multiple cohorts and accounts for individual cohort differences in mixture analyses.

abstract = {Background
As the World Trade Center (WTC) General Responder Cohort ages, it is imperative to study their aging process and identify factors that can be targeted for interventions.
Objectives
Our goal was to utilize a previously developed WTC Clinical Frailty Index (CFI) to identify distinct frailty trajectories and associated factors in this cohort.
Design
A latent class mixed model evaluated frailty trajectories using WTC CFIs. Multinomial regression models were used to assess associations between frailty trajectory and sociodemographic and WTC characteristics.
Setting
We utilized data collected during routine WTC monitoring visits from 2004 until 2021.
Participants
The participants were WTC general responders.
Measurements
Relative risk ratios (RRR) assessed associations with a 95 % confidence interval (CI).
Results
Three distinct linear frailty trajectories were identified: high CFI (indicating higher frailty), low CFI, and progressively increasing CFI. Compared with the low CFI group, females were more likely to be in the high CFI and progressively increasing CFI groups (RRR 1.66, 95 %CI 1.46, 1.90; RRR 1.32, 95 %CI 1.15, 1.53, respectively). Education beyond high school and elevated income were protective against high CFI and progressively increasing CFI groups. Individuals that self-identified as Hispanic had an elevated RRR for the high CFI group (RRR 1.17, 95 %CI 1.04, 1.31). Occupation on 9/11, such as construction and maintenance and repair, as well as high/very high WTC exposure were significantly associated with both the high CFI and progressively increasing CFI groups.
Conclusions
Several sociodemographic and WTC variables were associated with more hazardous frailty trajectories in WTC general responders. This work is beneficial to informing and directing future interventions for those at higher-risk for more hazardous frailty progression.}

abstract = {Introduction
Prenatal phthalate exposure may influence lung development and lead to wheezing and asthma in childhood, and these associations may vary by sex. Despite ubiquity of exposure, there is limited epidemiologic data on these associations in Latin America.
Methods
We assessed 593 mother-child dyads enrolled in the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment, and Social Stressors birth cohort in Mexico City. We quantified 15 phthalate metabolites in 2nd and 3rd trimester maternal urine. Report of ever wheeze, wheeze in the past 12 months (current wheeze) and ever asthma were obtained using a validated survey when children were 4 and 6 years of age. We examined individual associations with modified Poisson models. Mixture effects were assessed using Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sum (BWQS) regression. All models were adjusted for child's sex, maternal age and education at enrollment, and parity.
Results
In Poisson models, a doubling of mono (carboxy-isononyl) phthalate (MCNP) during the 2nd trimester was associated with higher risk of wheeze (RR: 1.14, 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.29), and asthma (RR: 1.44, 95 % CI: 1.05, 1.97) at 4 years of age. Higher concentrations of the sum of di-isononyl phthalate metabolites (∑DiNP) during the 2nd trimester were also associated with asthma at 4 years of age (RR: 1.30, 95 % CI: 1.04, 1.61). Mixture associations of phthalate metabolite concentrations during the 2nd trimester and asthma at 4 years of age were stronger in males (BWQS, OR: 1.94, 95 % CI: 0.90, 4.60; 90 % CrI: 1.04, 3.73) compared to females (BWQS, OR: 1.23, 95 % CI: 0.56, 2.88; 90 % CrI: 0.61, 2.55). Additionally, we observed stronger inverse associations between prenatal phthalate mixtures during the 3rd trimester and current wheeze at 4 and 6 years of age in females (BWQS, OR: 0.54, 90 % CrI: 0.35, 0.82; OR: 0.45, 90 % CrI: 0.22, 0.84) compared to males (BWQS, OR: 0.95, 90 % Cri: 0.68, 1.35; OR: 0.97, 90 % CrI: 0.59, 1.54).
Conclusions
Prenatal phthalate metabolite concentrations were associated with respiratory outcomes in childhood, with some evidence of sex specific effects. Future work investigating phthalate exposure and wheeze trajectories/lung function will be important for understanding how these may predict later disease.}

Several classes of environmental contaminants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient temperature, have been shown to alter hormone biosynthesis or activity. However, epidemiologic research has not considered PM2.5 in relation to a broader range of steroid hormones, particularly in pregnant women. Using metabolomics data collected within 20–40 weeks of gestation in an ethnically diverse pregnancy cohort study, we identified 42 steroid hormones that we grouped into five classes (pregnenolone, androgens, estrogens, progestin, and corticosteroids) based on their biosynthesis type. We found that exposure to PM2.5 during the pre-conception and early prenatal periods was associated with higher maternal androgen concentrations in late pregnancy. We also detected a positive association between early pregnancy PM2.5 exposure and maternal pregnenolone levels and a marginal positive association between early pregnancy PM2.5 exposure and progestin levels. When considering each hormone metabolite individually, we found positive associations between early pregnancy PM2.5 exposure and five steroids, two of which survived multiple comparison testing: 11beta-hydroxyandrosterone glucuronide (a pregnenolone steroid) and adrosteroneglucuronide (a progestin steroid). None of the steroid classes were statistically significant associated with ambient temperature. In sex-stratified analyses, we did not detect any sex differences in our associations. This is the first study showing that exposure to fine particulate matter during the pre-conception and early prenatal periods can lead to altered steroid adaptation during the state of pregnancy, which has been shown to have potential consequences on maternal and child health.}

Lead is a toxic chemical of public health concern, however limited biomarkers are able to reconstruct prior lead exposures in early-life when biospecimens are not collected and stored. Although child tooth dentine measurements accurately assess past child perinatal lead exposure, it has not been established if they reflect maternal exposure in pregnancy.
Aim
To assess the prenatal relationship between child tooth dentine and maternal blood lead measurements and to estimate maternal lead exposure during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy from weekly child dentine profiles.
Methods
We measured early-life lead exposure in child tooth dentine and maternal blood from 419 child-mother dyads enrolled in the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stress (PROGRESS) cohort. We employed the Super-Learner algorithm to determine the relationship of dentine lead data with maternal blood lead concentrations and to predict maternal lead from child dentine lead data in blinded analyses. We validated and quantified the bias of our results internally.
Results
Mothers had moderate blood lead levels (trimesters: 2nd = 29.45 ug/L, 3rd = 31.78 ug/L). Trimester-averaged and weekly child dentine lead measurements were highly correlated with maternal blood levels in the corresponding trimesters. The predicted trimester-specific maternal lead levels were significantly correlated with actual measured blood values (trimesters: 2nd = 0.83; 3rd = 0.88). Biomarkers of maternal lead exposure discriminated women highly exposed to lead (>mean) with 85 % and 96 % specificity in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, respectively, with 80 % sensitivity.
Discussion
Weekly child dentine lead levels can serve as biomarkers of past child and maternal lead exposures during pregnancy.}

Phthalate exposure has been associated with increased childhood behavioral problems. Existing studies failed to include phthalate replacements and did not account for high correlations among phthalates. Phthalates’ exposure is higher in Mexico than in U.S. locations, making it an ideal target population for this study.
Aim
To examine associations between 15 maternal prenatal phthalate metabolite concentrations and children's behavioral problems.
Methods
We quantified phthalate metabolites in maternal urine samples from maternal-child dyads (n = 514) enrolled in the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth Environment and Social Stress (PROGRESS) birth cohort in Mexico City. We performed least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regressions to identify associations between specific-gravity adjusted log2-transformed phthalate metabolites and parent-reported 4–6 year old behavior on the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2), accounting for metabolite correlations. We adjusted for socio-demographic and birth-related factors, and examined associations stratified by sex.
Results
Higher prenatal mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl terephthalate (MECPTP) urinary concentrations were associated with increased hyperactivity scores in the overall sample (β = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.17, 1.13) and in girls (β = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.16, 1.08), overall behavioral problems in boys (β = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.20, 1.15), and depression scores in boys (β = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.06, 0.88). Higher prenatal monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) concentrations were associated with reduced hyperactivity scores in girls (ß = −0.54, 95% CI = −1.08, −0.21).
Discussion
Our findings suggested that prenatal concentrations of phthalates and their replacements altered child neurodevelopment and those associations may be influenced sex.}

abstract = {Background
Birthweight is an indicator of fetal growth and environmental-related alterations of birthweight have been linked with multiple disorders and conditions progressing into adulthood. Although a few studies have assessed the association between birthweight and the totality of exogenous exposures and their downstream molecular responses in maternal urine and cord blood; no prior research has considered a) the maternal serum prenatal metabolome, which is enriched for hormones, and b) non-linear and synergistic associations among exposures.
Methods
We measured the maternal serum metabolome during pregnancy using an untargeted metabolomics approach and birthweight for gestational age (BWGA) z-score in 410 mother-child dyads enrolled in the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort. We leveraged a Bayesian factor analysis for interaction to select the most important metabolites associated with BWGA z-score and to evaluate their linear, non-linear and non-additive associations. We also assessed the primary biological functions of the identified proteins using the MetaboAnalyst, a centralized repository of curated functional information. We compared our findings with those of a traditional metabolite-wide association study (MWAS) in which metabolites are individually associated with BWGA z-score.
Results
Among 1110 metabolites, 46 showed evidence of U-shape associations with BWGA z-score. Most of the identified metabolites (85%) were lipids primarily enriched for pathways central to energy production, immune function, and androgen and estrogen metabolism, which are essential for pregnancy and parturition processes. Metabolites within the same class, i.e. steroids and phospholipids, showed synergistic relationships with each other.
Conclusions
Our results support that the aspects of the maternal metabolome during pregnancy contribute linearly, non-linearly and synergistically to variation in newborn birthweight.}

abstract = {Background
Environmental exposures including air pollutants, toxic metals, and psychosocial stress have been associated with shorter telomere length (TL) in newborns. These exposures have in turn been linked to an enhanced inflammatory immune response. Increased inflammation during pregnancy may be a central biological pathway linking environmental factors with reduced TL at birth. Approaches that more comprehensively characterize the prenatal inflammatory milieu rather than targeting specific individual cytokines in relation to newborn TL may better elucidate inflammatory mechanisms.
Methods
Analyses included 129 mother-child dyads enrolled in the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) pregnancy cohort. We measured 92 inflammation related proteins during pregnancy in maternal serum using the Olink protein array and quantified cord blood relative leukocyte TL (rLTL) via qPCR. We leveraged a tree-based machine learning algorithm to select the most important inflammatory related proteins jointly associated with rLTL. We then evaluated the combined association between the selected proteins with rLTL using Bayesian Weighted Quantile Sum (BWQS) Regression. Analyses were adjusted for gestational week of serum collection, maternal race/ethnicity, age, and education, and fetal sex. We evaluated major biological function of the identified proteins by using the UniProtKB, a centralized repository of curated functional information.
Results
Three proteins were negatively and linearly associated with rLTL (CASP8 β: -0.22 p = 0.008, BNGF β: -0.43 p = 0.033, TRANCE β: 0.38 p = 0.004). Results from BWQS regression showed a significant overall decrease in rLTL (β: -0.26 95%CrI: -0.43, −0.07) per quartile increase of the mixture, with CASP8 contributing the greatest weight (CASP8 50%; BNGF 27%, and TRANCE 23%). The identified proteins were involved in the regulation of apoptotic processes and cell proliferation.
Conclusions
This proteomics approach identifies novel maternal prenatal inflammatory protein biomarkers associated with shortened rLTL in newborns.}
