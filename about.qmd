## Introduction

Quantitative Data Scientist with over 8 years of experience bridging research, energy, and finance. My expertise lies in statistical modeling, machine learning, and Bayesian methods, backed by a strong publication record in peer-reviewed journals. Whether it's developing disease progression models for Alzheimer's research, optimizing investment portfolios through advanced time series analysis, or forecasting commodity prices in the energy sector to identify profitable opportunities, I thrive on turning complex data into actionable insights. From engineering automated data pipelines to transform clinical trial information into analysis-ready formats, to crafting custom statistical packages for environmental health studies, I've honed my mathematical prowess across diverse tools and environments. At the Icahn School of Medicine, I delved into multi-omics datasets using dimensionality reduction methods, uncovering biomarkers that drive real-world impact. In finance, I applied forecasting models and optimization strategies to detect trading patterns and maximize risk-adjusted returns, while in energy, I built mathematical models for portfolio monitoring and risk control, drawing on data mining to enhance market intelligence. This diverse background—from healthcare innovations to financial strategies and energy market dynamics—fuels cross-fertilization of ideas, allowing me to apply insights from one field to solve challenges in another. With a Master's in Statistics and Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics from top Italian universities, I'm passionate about leveraging these skills to solve challenging problems

## Work Experience

- **Quantitative Medicine Scientist (Data Scientist) – Pharmacometrics** | Critical Path Institute, Remote, US | September 2024 – Present

  - Developed disease progression models using linear/non-linear mixed effects frameworks in R and Stan, applying frequentist and Bayesian approaches to analyze longitudinal Alzheimer’s data and identify predictive biomarkers.
  - Engineered automated ETL pipelines in R to transform clinical trial data from SDTM/ADaM standards into analysis-ready datamarts with comprehensive data quality checks and validation procedures.


- **Biostatistician II (Data Scientist)** | Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY | February 2019 – April 2024

  - Analyzed multi-omics datasets (metabolomics, epigenetics) using machine learning, dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), and linear mixed-effects models for biomarker identification and pathway validation in R.
  - Developed Bayesian mixture regression R package using Stan and applied advanced time series models (Distributed Lag Models, ARIMA, Bayesian splines, Gaussian State Space Models) for environmental health analysis using Stan, JAGS, and R.
  - Implemented machine learning pipelines (XGBoost, tree-based models, polynomial regression) for biomarker prediction and validation on large-scale genomic data using R and Julia.
  - Built automated ETL pipelines and reproducible workflows using SQL, R, and DuckDB, generating publication-ready reports with RMarkdown/Quarto, ggplot2, and plotly for peer-reviewed publications.
  - Conducted EWAS (environment-wide association studies) on placenta methylation and child blood pressure; developed BWQS algorithms for PFAS exposure and bone mineral density; applied DLNM on pregnancy environmental data for maternal outcomes; investigated metal exposures on fetal antibody responses; used Bayesian Factor Analysis for metabolite effects on birth weight; developed HBWQS for chemical mixtures across cohorts.
